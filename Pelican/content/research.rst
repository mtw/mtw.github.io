          <p>The study of RNA viruses holds particular significance for <em>synthetic biology</em>. My research on RNA viruses provides a deep understanding of their complex interplay between structure and function, which is crucial for designing novel biological systems. This includes:</p>

          <ul>
          <li> Predicting the intricate structures of RNA molecules in 2D and 3D</li>
          <li> Designing molecular devices like riboswitches for synthetic biology applications</li>
          <li> Uncovering RNA's hidden complexities through RNA structure probing</strong>
          <li> Advancing RNA structure prediction with artificial intelligence</li>
          <li> Investigating the fascinating world of RNA-protein interactions</li>
          <li> Revealing co-transcriptional RNA folding dynamics</li>
          <li> Exploring multifaceted RNA folding dynamics and energy landscapes</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>These research areas collectively fuel my commitment to advancing our understanding of <strong>RNA</strong> and its broader significance in the realm of synthetic biology, biotechnology, and healthcare.</p>
