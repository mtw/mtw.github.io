At the intersection of **synthetic biology** and **computational RNA science**, my research uncovers the complex relationship between *RNA structure and function*. Among my long-term research priorities is the study of RNA viruses, where I investigate how evolutionary pressures shape RNA structures, which, in turn, influence virus behavior and pathogenicity. This knowledge offers valuable insight into the biological mechanisms that drive pathogen evolution and emergence. Furthermore, it provides a robust foundation for the *de-novo design* of innovative biological systems, such as *artificial riboswitches*.
