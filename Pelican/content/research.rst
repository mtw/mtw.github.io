  <p>At the intersection of <em>synthetic biology</em> and <em>computational RNA science</em>, my research uncovers the complex interplay between <strong>RNA structure and function</strong>. Among my long-term research priorities is the study of RNA viruses, where I explore how how evolutionary pressures shape RNA structures, which in turn influence virus behavior and pathogenicity. This knowledge provides novel insight into the biological mechanisms that drive pathogen evolution and emergence. Furthermore, it serves as a valuable foundation for the <em>de-novo design</em> of innovative biological systems, such as <em>artificial riboswitches</em>.</p>

Key Research Interests
