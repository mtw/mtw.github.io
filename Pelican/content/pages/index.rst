          <p>These research areas collectively fuel my commitment to advancing our understanding of <strong>RNA biology</strong> and its broader significance in the fields of biology and biotechnology.</p>
          Currently, I hold the position of a visiting professor at the <a href="http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/team.html"> University of Freiburg Bioinformatics Group</a>. In addition, I maintain affiliations with the <a href="https://bcb.cs.univie.ac.at/"> Research Group Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) </a> and the <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/"> Theoretical Biochemistry Group (TBI)</a> at the Department of Theoretical Chemistry, University of Vienna. These academic groups are renowned for their contributions to the development of the <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA"> ViennaRNA Package</a>, a widely used resource in the field of <strong>RNA bioinformatics</strong>.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Beyond my academic endeavors, I have established <a href="https://rnaforecast.com">RNA Forecast</a>, a venture with a mission to emphasize the significance of RNA structure within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors. Together, we strive to integrate the <strong>One Health</strong> approach with the power of virus bioinformatics to tackle the complex challenges posed by RNA viruses, safeguarding the health of all living organisms on our planet.
