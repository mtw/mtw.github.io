              <p>As a theoretical biochemist with a deep passion for <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>computational RNA biology</strong>, I am captivated by how AI can reshape our understanding and design of biological systems. My research spans the intersection of <em>synthetic biology</em>, <em>bioinformatics</em>, and <em>AI-driven approaches</em> to solve complex biological questions.</p>

          <p>By leveraging machine learning and advanced computational models, my work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the fields of <em>synthetic biology</em> and <em>AI-driven bioinformatics</em>. This synergy opens exciting possibilities for innovation in the life sciences.</p>

          <p>I currently lead research as a Principal Investigator at the University of Vienna. Previously, I held a visiting professor position at the <a href="http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/team.html"> University of Freiburg Bioinformatics Group</a>.
          I maintain affiliations with the <a href="https://bcb.cs.univie.ac.at/"> Research Group Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) </a> and the <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/"> Theoretical Biochemistry Group (TBI)</a> at the Department of Theoretical Chemistry, University of Vienna. These academic groups are renowned for their contributions to the development of the <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA"> ViennaRNA Package</a>, a widely used resource in the field of <strong>RNA bioinformatics</strong>.</p>

          <p>Beyond my academic endeavors, I have established <a href="https://rnaforecast.com">RNA Forecast</a>, a venture with a mission to emphasize the significance of <strong>RNA structure</strong> within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors. </p>
