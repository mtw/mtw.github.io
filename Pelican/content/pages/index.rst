        By leveraging machine learning and advanced computational models, :link-flat:`my research <{filename}/research.rst>` aims to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the field of *synthetic biology* and *AI-driven bioinformatics*. This synergy opens exciting possibilities for innovation in the life sciences. 

        I currently lead research as a Principal Investigator at the University of Vienna, Austria. In 2023/2024, I was a visiting professor at the :link-flat:`University of Freiburg Bioinformatics Group <http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/team.html>`. I am affiliated with both the :link-flat:`Research Group Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) <https://bcb.cs.univie.ac.at/>` and the :link-flat:`Theoretical Biochemistry Group (TBI) <http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/>` at the University of Vienna. These academic groups are renowned for their contributions to **RNA bioinformatics**, including the development of the :link-flat:`ViennaRNA Package <http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA>`, a widely used tool in the field.

        Beyond my academic work, I founded :link-flat:`RNA Forecast <https://rnaforecast.com>`, a venture dedicated to advancing the understanding and application of **RNA structure** in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Our mission is to drive innovation by leveraging RNA's potential in drug development and biotechnological solutions.
