              <p>As a theoretical biochemist with a deep passion for <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>computational RNA biology</strong>, I am captivated by how AI can reshape our understanding and design of biological systems. My research spans the intersection of <em>synthetic biology</em>, <em>bioinformatics</em>, and <em>AI-driven approaches</em> to solve complex biological questions.</p>

          <p>By leveraging machine learning and advanced computational models, my work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the fields of <em>synthetic biology</em> and <em>AI-driven bioinformatics</em>. This synergy opens exciting possibilities for innovation in the life sciences.</p>

          <p>I currently lead research as a Principal Investigator at the University of Vienna, Austria. In 2023/2024, I was a visiting professor at the <a href="http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/team.html"> University of Freiburg Bioinformatics Group</a>.
          I am affiliated with both the <a href="https://bcb.cs.univie.ac.at/"> Research Group Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) </a> and the <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/"> Theoretical Biochemistry Group (TBI)</a> at University of Vienna. These academic groups are renowned for their contributions to <strong>RNA bioinformatics</strong>, including the development of the <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA"> ViennaRNA Package</a>, a widely used tool in the field.

          <p>Beyond my academic work, I founded  <a href="https://rnaforecast.com">RNA Forecast</a>, a venture dedicated to advancing the understanding and application of <strong>RNA structure</strong> in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Our mission is to drive innovation by leveraging RNA's potential in drug development and biotechnological solutions.</p>
