This article focuses on the design rules for de-novo or re-design of riboswitches in synthetic biology applications. We present an efficient approach for the computational prediction of co-transcriptional RNA riboswitch folding in the presence of a ligand. Using the I-A 2’-deoxyguanosine (2’dG)-sensing riboswitch from Mesoplasma florum, which has recently been studied by NMR spectroscopy, as an example we show that our results are in good agreement with experimental data. Computational predictions yield substantial mechanistic insight, allowing us not only to understand natural riboswitches on a mechanistic level but also to perform systematic in silico screening and analysis of novel designs before expensive experimental validation.

.. frame:: Abstract

  Riboswitches form an abundant class of cis-regulatory RNA elements that mediate gene expression by binding a small metabolite. For synthetic biology applications, they are becoming cheap and accessible systems for selectively triggering transcription or translation of downstream genes. Many riboswitches are kinetically controlled, hence knowledge of their co-transcriptional mechanisms is essential. We present here an efficient implementation for analyzing co-transcriptional RNA-ligand interaction dynamics. This approach allows for the first time to model concentration-dependent metabolite binding/unbinding kinetics. We exemplify this novel approach by means of the recently studied I-A 2′-deoxyguanosine (2′dG)-sensing riboswitch from Mesoplasma florum.
