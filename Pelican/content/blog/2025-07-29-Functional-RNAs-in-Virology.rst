I will be serving as Guest Editor for the :link-flat-strong:`Functional RNAs in Virology <https://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/special_issues/3R6GL2NBRK>` Special Issue, and my aim is to curate articles that shed light on the diverse roles played by viral RNAs‚Äîboth structured and unstructured‚Äîacross all stages of the viral lifecycle. Far beyond acting as genetic messengers, viral RNAs have emerged as active regulators that orchestrate translation, replication, genome packaging, immune evasion, and host adaptation.

Why This Collection Matters
---------------------------

RNA plays a central role in virtually every biological process, from gene regulation to the assembly of protein complexes. Yet its complexity poses formidable analytical challenges. Over the past few years, deep learning has transformed the way we decode protein structures and genomic data. Now, we stand on the edge of a similar revolution in RNA biology:

- **Uncover hidden patterns** in high‚Äëthroughput sequencing data
- **Predict RNA modifications** and their functional impacts
- **Model secondary & tertiary structures** with unprecedented accuracy
- **Design synthetic RNAs** for therapeutics and synthetic biology
- **Map RNA‚Äìprotein interactions** and regulatory switches at scale

What We‚Äôre Looking For
----------------------

By pooling insights from biochemists, computational biologists and AI specialists, this special issue aims to chart the next frontier in RNA research. We welcome original research, methods papers and in‚Äëdepth reviews on topics including (but not limited to):

- üìà Deep learning for transcriptome analysis
- üîç AI models of RNA modifications
- üèóÔ∏è Secondary & tertiary structure prediction
- ‚ú® AI‚Äëdriven RNA design & editing
- üß© RNA‚Äìprotein interaction mapping
- üîÑ Automated annotation of RNA architectures
