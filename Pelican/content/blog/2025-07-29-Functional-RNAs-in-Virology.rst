I‚Äôm honored to serve as Guest Editor for :link-flat-strong:`Functional RNAs in Virology <https://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses/special_issues/3R6GL2NBRK>` Special Issue. My goal is to curate a collection of high-quality articles that explore how viral RNAs, both structured and unstructured, control translation, replication, genome packaging, immune evasion, and host adaptation.

Understanding the Role of RNA in Viruses
----------------------------------------

Far beyond acting as genetic messengers, viral RNAs have emerged as active regulators that shape virtually every step of the infection cycle. From modulating protein synthesis to regulating host interactions and genome replication, these RNAs form a molecular toolkit that viruses rely on for survival and success.

Structured elements such as IRESs, frame-shifting pseudoknots, and exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs), together with unstructured sequence motifs, form an intricate regulatory network that allows viruses to thrive in diverse cellular environments. Recent discoveries, including computational predictions of highly conserved RNA elements across viral families, emphasize the evolutionary significance of RNA-based regulation.

Understanding how viruses exploit RNA structure and sequence is essential not only to decode their infection strategies but also to identify novel targets for antiviral intervention.


Scope of the Special Issue
--------------------------

The **Functional RNAs in Virology** Special Issue aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how RNA acts as a regulatory molecule in viral infection. We welcome both original research articles and reviews that explore well-characterized RNA elements as well as emerging discoveries. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- üß¨ **Functional RNA structures** involved in translation, replication, and genome packaging
- üîÑ **Long-range RNA‚ÄìRNA interactions** and RNA conformational switches
- üß™ **Viral non-coding RNAs**
- üî¨ **Exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs)** and RNA-driven immune evasion
- üåê **RNA structural conservation** and covariation across virus species or lineages
- üß† **Computational discovery and modeling** of functional RNA elements
- üß≤ **RNA‚Äìprotein interactions** involving viral RNAs and host factors
- üß´ **RNA structure probing** and high-throughput functional RNA screening in viruses

A Timely Focus
--------------

In recent years, experimental advances and large-scale sequencing efforts have dramatically expanded our ability to detect and characterize functional RNA elements in viral genomes. This growing body of research is reshaping our understanding of viral strategies and uncovering new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. By focusing on RNA-mediated regulation across viral families, this Special Issue bridges molecular virology, RNA biology, and computational genomics.

Join the Special Issue
