Zika virus (ZIKV) is a global health threat. With nearly 100 countries designated as ZIKV risk areas and a substantial impact on fetal development, innovative approaches to combat the virus are crucial. In our recent paper, we delved into the intricate world of ZIKV RNA structures and human protein interactions, sheding light on a potential therapeutic application.

G-quadruplexes (G4s) are particularly interesting RNA structures that play various roles in viruses and all domains of life. These structures can regulate transcription, translation, and even maintain genome stability. In ZIKV, a potential G-quadruplex sequence was located in the 3' terminal region (TR) using a quadruplex-forming G-rich sequences Mapper, but its conservation and role in larger ZIKV RNA transcripts remained unexplored.

Our research establishes that the ZIKV 3' TR G4 is conserved across all ZIKV isolates and retains its structure in a 3' TR full-length transcript. This G4 formation was confirmed using pyridostatin and the BG4 G4-recognizing antibody binding assays. Crucially, we found that human DEAD-box helicases, DDX3X132-607 and DDX17135-555, bind to the 3' TR, and that DDX17135-555 unfolds the G4 in the 3' TR. This unraveling of the G4 structure presents an opportunity for therapeutic targeting.

Understanding the ZIKV G4 structure and its interactions with human proteins is essential for a comprehensive One Health approach, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. ZIKV, transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, not only leads to congenital disabilities in utero but can also cause debilitating symptoms in adults. A nuanced understanding of the virus's replication mechanisms through our study can facilitate the development of targeted treatments, reducing the disease burden on vulnerable populations.

Our discovery allows us to contemplate potential treatments using G4 binding molecules or other molecules that disrupt human DDX17–3' SL interaction. Though more research is needed to understand the function of the 3' SL G4 during viral replication, our study lays the groundwork for innovative therapeutics against ZIKV.

In the absence of ZIKV treatments or vaccines, our research sheds light on the potential of targeting specific RNA structures and their interactions with human proteins. By understanding and leveraging these interactions, we may open new doors in the fight against ZIKV, contributing to a holistic One Health strategy.

Stay tuned for more insights into the world of RNA structures and their roles in viral replication, as we continue our quest to unveil novel therapeutic possibilities against Zika virus.

.. frame:: Abstract

   Zika virus (ZIKV) infection remains a worldwide concern, and currently no effective treatments or vaccines are available. Novel therapeutics are an avenue of interest that could probe viral RNA-human protein communication to stop viral replication. One specific RNA structure, G-quadruplexes (G4s), possess various roles in viruses and all domains of life, including transcription and translation regulation and genome stability, and serves as nucleation points for RNA liquid-liquid phase separation. Previous G4 studies on ZIKV using a quadruplex forming G-rich sequences Mapper located a potential G-quadruplex sequence in the 3′ terminal region (TR) and was validated structurally using a 25-mer oligo. It is currently unknown if this structure is conserved and maintained in a large ZIKV RNA transcript and its specific roles in viral replication. Using bioinformatic analysis and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that the ZIKV 3′ TR G4 is conserved across all ZIKV isolates and maintains its structure in a 3′ TR full-length transcript. We further established the G4 formation using pyridostatin and the BG4 G4-recognizing antibody binding assays. Our study also demonstrates that the human DEAD-box helicases, DDX3X132-607 and DDX17135-555, bind to the 3′ TR and that DDX17135-555 unfolds the G4 present in the 3′ TR. These findings provide a path forward in potential therapeutic targeting of DDX3X or DDX17’s binding to the 3′ TR G4 region for novel treatments against ZIKV.
