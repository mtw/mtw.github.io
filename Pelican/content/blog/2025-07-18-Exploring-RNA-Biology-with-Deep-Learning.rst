I will be serving as Guest Editor for the :link-flat-strong:`RNA Biology article collection ‚ÄúExploring RNA Biology with Deep Learning Algorithms‚Äù <https://think.taylorandfrancis.com/article_collections/exploring-rna-biology-with-deep-learning-algorithms/>`. My aim is to curate articles that showcase how machine learning models can reveal hidden patterns in sequencing data, predict complex three dimensional RNA shapes with high accuracy and guide the design of novel RNA molecules for both research and therapeutic use.

Why This Collection Matters
---------------------------

RNA plays a central role in virtually every biological process, from gene regulation to the assembly of protein complexes. Yet its complexity poses formidable analytical challenges. Over the past few years, deep learning has transformed the way we decode protein structures and genomic data. Now, we stand on the edge of a similar revolution in RNA biology:

- **Uncover hidden patterns** in high‚Äëthroughput sequencing data
- **Predict RNA modifications** and their functional impacts
- **Model secondary & tertiary structures** with unprecedented accuracy
- **Design synthetic RNAs** for therapeutics and synthetic biology
- **Map RNA‚Äìprotein interactions** and regulatory switches at scale

What We‚Äôre Looking For
----------------------

By pooling insights from biochemists, computational biologists and AI specialists, this special issue aims to chart the next frontier in RNA research. We welcome original research, methods papers and in‚Äëdepth reviews on topics including (but not limited to):

- üìà Deep learning for transcriptome analysis
- üîç AI models of RNA modifications
- üèóÔ∏è Secondary & tertiary structure prediction
- ‚ú® AI‚Äëdriven RNA design & editing
- üß© RNA‚Äìprotein interaction mapping
- üîÑ Automated annotation of RNA architectures

Advisory Panel
