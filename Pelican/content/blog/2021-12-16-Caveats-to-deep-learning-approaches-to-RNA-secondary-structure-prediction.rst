:description: Existing AI methods for RNA structure prediction face issues due to biased training data, leading to poor predictions for diverse RNA molecules
:summary: RNA structure prediction might seem like an ideal fit for machine learning, but it's more challenging than you might think. In this paper, we explore these difficulties by using synthetic data generated by ViennaRNA's RNAfold, offering a controlled environment to study how neural networks handle RNA secondary structure prediction. What we found suggests that the limitations seen in artificial settings can directly translate to real-world data, raising important questions about the effectiveness of current machine learning approaches in this field.

One of the major issues we discovered is that many published AI models for RNA structure prediction rely on highly biased training sets. This bias significantly impacts the accuracy of predictions when the models are tested on RNA sequences outside of their training set. By using a technique known as inverse RNA folding—where we generate sequences that match specific structures—we created synthetic data with the same kind of bias found in these deep learning models. When we trained a neural network on this biased data, it performed well on new sequences that folded into familiar structures. However, when faced with sequences forming novel structures, the performance dropped drastically. This shows that while the network could generalize to new sequences, it struggled to predict new or unseen structures.

Even more surprising is that many deep learning methods trained on unbiased data couldn't even reliably predict base pairing—a fundamental aspect of RNA structure that's simpler than the full RNA folding problem. Additionally, certain models, such as BLSTMs, predicted structural features like pseudoknots and base triplets, which don’t even appear in the ViennaRNA RNAfold ground truth. This mismatch between model output and reality underscores the limitations of these approaches.

Our findings reveal significant gaps in current machine learning models for RNA structure prediction and highlight the need for more robust training methods. These insights could drive future improvements in how AI is applied to RNA biology, especially for tackling more complex tasks like RNA folding.

.. frame:: Abstract


   Machine learning (ML) and in particular deep learning techniques have gained popularity for predicting structures from biopolymer sequences. An interesting case is the prediction of RNA secondary structures, where well established biophysics based methods exist. These methods even yield exact solutions under certain simplifying assumptions. Nevertheless, the accuracy of these classical methods is limited and has seen little improvement over the last decade. This makes it an attractive target for machine learning and consequently several deep learning models have been proposed in recent years. In this contribution we discuss limitations of current approaches, in particular due to biases in the training data. Furthermore, we propose to study capabilities and limitations of ML models by first applying them on synthetic data that can not only be generated in arbitrary amounts, but are also guaranteed to be free of biases. We apply this idea by testing several ML models of varying complexity. Finally, we show that the best models are capable of capturing many, but not all, properties of RNA secondary structures. Most severely, the number of predicted base pairs scales quadratically with sequence length, even though a secondary structure can only accommodate a linear number of pairs.
