With the advent of efficient strategies for experimental RNA structure
validation, especially combination of chemical probing with next-generation
sequencing technologies, came demand to couple experimental data,
e.g. SHAPE reactivities, with *in silico* RNA structure prediction tools. In
this line, the computational structure prediction is guided by *in vitro* or
even *in vivo* probing data.

We have recently implemented three previously published methods for
incorporation of SHAPE probing data into the *ViennaRNA Package* and
benchmarked prediction results with a set of RNAs with known reference
structures.

Don't miss the `Supplementary Data <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/09/23/bioinformatics.btv523/suppl/DC1>`_
since it contains extensive coverage of the applied benchmark strategies
and lots of background information.

.. block-default:: Abstract

  **Summary:** Chemical mapping experiments allow for nucleotide resolution
  assessment of RNA structure. We demonstrate that different strategies of
  integrating probing data with thermodynamics-based RNA secondary
  structure prediction algorithms can be implemented by means of soft
  constraints. This amounts to incorporating suitable pseudo-energies into
  the standard energy model for RNA secondary structures. As a showcase
  application for this new feature of the ViennaRNA Package we compare
  three distinct, previously published strategies to utilize SHAPE
  reactivities for structure prediction. The new tool is benchmarked on a
  set of RNAs with known reference structure.

  **Availability and implementation:** The capability for SHAPE directed RNA
  folding is part of the upcoming release of the ViennaRNA Package 2.2, for
  which a preliminary release is already freely available at
  <http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA>.
