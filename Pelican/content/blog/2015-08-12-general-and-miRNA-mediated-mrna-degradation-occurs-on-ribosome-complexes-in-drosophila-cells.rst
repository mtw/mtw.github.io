mRNA degradation and translation are two processes crucial for
posttranscriptional gene regulation. While the strong interconnection of
mRNA degradation and translation has been noted for many years, it has led
to the hypothesis that mRNAs could be degraded on the ribosome.

We have recently published a study that strongly supports the hypothesis
that the ribosome is a very general site not only for general 5' to 3'
mRNA degradation in *Drosophila* but also for the miRNA-mediated mRNA
degradation pathway:


.. block-default:: Abstract

  The translation and degradation of mRNAs are two key steps in gene
  expression that are highly regulated and targeted by many factors,
  including microRNAs (miRNAs). While it is well established that translation
  and mRNA degradation are tightly coupled, it is still not entirely clear
  where in the cell mRNA degradation takes place. In this study, we
  investigated the possibility of mRNA degradation on the ribosome in
  Drosophila cells. Using polysome profiles and ribosome affinity
  purification, we could demonstrate the copurification of various
  deadenylation and decapping factors with ribosome complexes. Also, AGO1 and
  GW182, two key factors in the miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation pathway, were
  associated with ribosome complexes. Their copurification was dependent on
  intact mRNAs, suggesting the association of these factors with the mRNA
  rather than the ribosome itself. Furthermore, we isolated decapped mRNA
  degradation intermediates from ribosome complexes and performed
  high-throughput sequencing analysis. Interestingly, 93% of the decapped
  mRNA fragments (approximately 12,000) could be detected at the same
  relative abundance on ribosome complexes and in cell lysates. In summary,
  our findings strongly indicate the association of the majority of bulk
  mRNAs as well as mRNAs targeted by miRNAs with the ribosome during their
  degradation.
