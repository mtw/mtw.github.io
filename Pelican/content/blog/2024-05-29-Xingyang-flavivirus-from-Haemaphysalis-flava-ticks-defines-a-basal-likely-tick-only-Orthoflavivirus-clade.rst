:summary: In this paper, we report the discovery of Xinyang flavivirus (XiFV), a novel virus isolated from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in China. Through phylogenetic analysis, we found that XiFV is closely related to other tick-only flaviviruses, such as Mpulungu flavivirus (MPFV) from Zambia and Ngoye virus (NGOV) from Senegal. This positions XiFV in a unique clade of orthoflaviviruses, a group that seems to infect only ticks, without any known vertebrate host.

What sets XiFV apart from many other flaviviruses is its apparent restriction to an arthropod-only life cycle. While most flaviviruses are transmitted between ticks and mammals or birds, XiFV shows no evidence of such transmission. Its genome exhibits traits similar to insect-specific flaviviruses, reinforcing the idea that it might be confined to ticks. Notably, XiFV and its close relatives lack a crucial protein cleavage site found in flaviviruses that infect vertebrates, further suggesting their life cycle is restricted to tick populations.

On a structural level, XiFV shares several characteristics with other orthoflaviviruses, particularly in the formation of complex RNA structures in its 3′ untranslated region. These structures are known to play a role in viral replication and evasion of host immune defenses. Our findings add to the growing understanding that a distinct group of tick-borne flaviviruses might not need a vertebrate host to survive, opening the door to further research into their ecology and interactions with other pathogens.

As this new virus continues to be studied, it highlights the importance of understanding the diverse life cycles and evolutionary pressures shaping tick-borne viruses, which could have broader implications for public health and virology.

.. frame:: Abstract

  Tick-borne orthoflaviviruses (TBFs) are classified into three conventional groups based on genetics and ecology: mammalian, seabird and probable-TBF group. Recently, a fourth basal group has been identified in Rhipicephalus ticks from Africa: Mpulungu flavivirus (MPFV) in Zambia and Ngoye virus (NGOV) in Senegal. Despite attempts, isolating these viruses in vertebrate and invertebrate cell lines or intracerebral injection of newborn mice with virus-containing homogenates has remained unsuccessful. In this study, we report the discovery of Xinyang flavivirus (XiFV) in Haemaphysalis flava ticks from Xìnyáng, Henan Province, China. Phylogenetic analysis shows that XiFV was most closely related to MPFV and NGOV, marking the first identification of this tick orthoflavivirus group in Asia. We developed a reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR assay to screen wild-collected ticks and egg clutches, with absolute infection rates of 20.75% in adult females and 15.19% in egg clutches, suggesting that XiFV could be potentially spread through transovarial transmission. To examine potential host range, dinucleotide composition analyses revealed that XiFV, MPFV and NGOV share a closer composition to classical insect-specific orthoflaviviruses than to vertebrate-infecting TBFs, suggesting that XiFV could be a tick-only orthoflavivirus. Additionally, both XiFV and MPFV lack a furin cleavage site in the prM protein, unlike other TBFs, suggesting these viruses might exist towards a biased immature particle state. To examine this, chimeric Binjari virus with XIFV- prME (bXiFV) was generated, purified and analysed by SDS-PAGE and negative-stain transmission electron microscopy, suggesting prototypical orthoflavivirus size (~50 nm) and bias towards uncleaved prM. In silico structural analyses of the 3'-untranslated regions show that XiFV forms up to five pseudo-knot-containing stem-loops and a prototypical orthoflavivirus dumbbell element, suggesting the potential for multiple exoribonuclease-resistant RNA structures.
