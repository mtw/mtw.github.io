:summary: In this publication, we describe the discovery of Xinyang flavivirus (XiFV), a novel tick-borne virus isolated from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in China. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that XiFV is closely related to other tick-only flaviviruses, such as Mpulungu flavivirus (MPFV) from Zambia and Ngoye virus (NGOV) from Senegal. This relationship places XiFV within a unique clade of orthoflaviviruses that appear to infect only ticks, without evidence of vertebrate infection

One of the most significant findings in this study is the lack of a vertebrate host for XiFV. Unlike many other flaviviruses, which are often transmitted between ticks and mammals or birds, XiFV shows genetic traits that suggest it may be restricted to an arthropod-only lifecycle. This is supported by analyses of the virus's genome, which revealed similarities to insect-specific flaviviruses. Additionally, XiFV and its closest relatives lack a critical protein cleavage site found in flaviviruses that infect vertebrates, further suggesting that these viruses may remain confined to tick populations.

Structurally, XiFV shares several features with other orthoflaviviruses, including the formation of complex RNA structures in its 3′ untranslated region, which are known to play a role in viral replication and evasion of host immune defenses. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that there is a distinct group of tick-borne flaviviruses that may not require a vertebrate host for survival, highlighting the need for further research into their ecology and potential interactions with other pathogens.

.. frame:: Abstract

  Tick-borne orthoflaviviruses (TBFs) are classified into three conventional groups based on genetics and ecology: mammalian, seabird and probable-TBF group. Recently, a fourth basal group has been identified in Rhipicephalus ticks from Africa: Mpulungu flavivirus (MPFV) in Zambia and Ngoye virus (NGOV) in Senegal. Despite attempts, isolating these viruses in vertebrate and invertebrate cell lines or intracerebral injection of newborn mice with virus-containing homogenates has remained unsuccessful. In this study, we report the discovery of Xinyang flavivirus (XiFV) in Haemaphysalis flava ticks from Xìnyáng, Henan Province, China. Phylogenetic analysis shows that XiFV was most closely related to MPFV and NGOV, marking the first identification of this tick orthoflavivirus group in Asia. We developed a reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR assay to screen wild-collected ticks and egg clutches, with absolute infection rates of 20.75% in adult females and 15.19% in egg clutches, suggesting that XiFV could be potentially spread through transovarial transmission. To examine potential host range, dinucleotide composition analyses revealed that XiFV, MPFV and NGOV share a closer composition to classical insect-specific orthoflaviviruses than to vertebrate-infecting TBFs, suggesting that XiFV could be a tick-only orthoflavivirus. Additionally, both XiFV and MPFV lack a furin cleavage site in the prM protein, unlike other TBFs, suggesting these viruses might exist towards a biased immature particle state. To examine this, chimeric Binjari virus with XIFV- prME (bXiFV) was generated, purified and analysed by SDS-PAGE and negative-stain transmission electron microscopy, suggesting prototypical orthoflavivirus size (~50 nm) and bias towards uncleaved prM. In silico structural analyses of the 3'-untranslated regions show that XiFV forms up to five pseudo-knot-containing stem-loops and a prototypical orthoflavivirus dumbbell element, suggesting the potential for multiple exoribonuclease-resistant RNA structures.
