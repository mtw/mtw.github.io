*In silico* identification of bacterial transcription start sites (TSS) has
been a major challenge for the last years. To address this issue, we have
developped `TSSAR <http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/TSSAR>`_, a statistical method
for analyzing dRNA-seq data, together with colleagues from the
Bioinformatics department at the University of Leipzig.


.. block-default:: Abstract

    **Background:** Differential RNA sequencing dRNA-seq is a high-throughput screening
    technique designed to examine the architecture of bacterial operons in
    general and the precise position of transcription start sites (TSS) in
    particular. Hitherto, dRNA-seq data were analyzed by visualizing the
    sequencing reads mapped to the reference genome and manually annotating
    reliable positions. This is very labor intensive and, due to the
    subjectivity, biased.

    **Results:** Here, we present **TSSAR**, a tool for automated de-novo TSS annotation
    from dRNA-seq data that respects the statistics of dRNA-seq
    libraries. **TSSAR** uses the premise that the number of sequencing reads
    starting at a certain genomic position within a transcriptional active
    region follows a Poisson distribution with a parameter that depends on the
    local strength of expression. The differences of two dRNA-seq library
    counts thus follow a Skellam distribution. This provides a statistical
    basis to identify significantly enriched primary transcripts.

    We assessed the performance by analyzing a publicly available dRNA-seq
    data set using **TSSAR** and two simple approaches that utilize
    user-defined score cutoffs. We evaluated the power of reproducing the
    manual TSS annotation. Furthermore, the same data set was used to
    reproduce 74 experimentally validated TSS in *H. pylori* from reliable
    techniques such as RACE or primer extension. Both analyses showed that
    **TSSAR** outperforms the static cutoff-dependent approaches.

    **Conclusions:** Having an automated and efficient tool for analyzing dRNA-seq data
    facilitates the use of the dRNA-seq technique and promotes its
    application to more sophisticated analysis. For instance, monitoring the
    plasticity and dynamics of the transcriptomal architecture triggered by
    different stimuli and growth conditions becomes possible.

    The main asset of a novel tool for dRNA-seq analysis that reaches out to
    a broad user community is usability. As such, we provide **TSSAR** both as
    intuitive RESTful Web service http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/TSSAR together
    with a set of post-processing and analysis tools, as well as a
    stand-alone version for use in high-throughput dRNA-seq data analysis
    pipelines.
