Exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs are a type of RNA molecule that possess unique properties in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of flaviviruses, a family of RNA viruses that includes notorious pathogens such as dengue virus and Zika virus. The 3'UTR is a non-coding region of the viral RNA genome that plays crucial roles in viral replication and immune evasion. Exoribonucleases are cellular enzymes that degrade RNA molecules, including viral RNA, as part of the host's antiviral defense mechanism. However, some flaviviruses have evolved to contain specific sequences in their 3'UTR that confer resistance to exoribonuclease degradation.

.. frame:: Abstract

   An efficient structural refinement technique for protein-RNA complexes is proposed based on a combination of AI-based modeling and flexible docking. Specifically, an enhanced sampling method called parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (PaCS-MD) was extended to include flexible docking to construct protein-RNA complexes from those obtained by AI-based modeling (AlphaFold2). With the present technique, the conformational sampling of flexible RNA regions is accelerated by PaCS-MD, enabling one to construct plausible models for protein-RNA complexes. For demonstration, PaCS-MD constructed several protein-RNA complexes of the RNA-binding Musashi-1 (MSI1) family of proteins, which were validated by comparing a group of crucial residues for RNA-binding with experimental complexes. Our analyses suggest that PaCS-MD improves the quality of complex modeling compared to the standard protocol based on template-based modeling (Phyre2). Furthermore, PaCS-MD could also be a beneficial technique for constructing complexes of non-native RNA-binding to proteins.
