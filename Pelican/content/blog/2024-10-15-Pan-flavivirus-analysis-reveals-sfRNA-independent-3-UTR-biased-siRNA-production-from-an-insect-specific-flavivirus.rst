RNAi is a key antiviral defense in mosquitoes, where viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is processed into viral small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs), which then target viral RNA for degradation. We found that for most flaviviruses, vsiRNAs were evenly distributed across the viral genome. However, for clasic insect-specific flaviviruses (cISFs), especially the Kamiti River virus (KRV), vsiRNA production was highly biased toward the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome. This was particularly striking for KRV, which has a uniquely long 3' UTR of about 1.2 kilobases. Over 95% of KRV-derived vsiRNAs were mapped to this region, suggesting a distinct RNA processing mechanism.

Additionally, the study explores the role of subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) in vsiRNA production. sfRNAs are produced when the XRN1 exoribonuclease stalls on structured RNA elements in the 3' UTR of flavivirus genomes, and they play various roles in viral replication and immune evasion. For KRV, two major sfRNAs were identified (sfRNA1 and sfRNA2), corresponding to predicted XRN1-resistant elements in the 3' UTR. However, despite the high abundance of these sfRNAs, the 3' UTR-biased vsiRNA production in KRV was found to be independent of sfRNA formation. This indicates that KRV's siRNA profile is shaped by other factors, likely a distinct viral RNA species processed by the RNAi machinery.

The findings suggest that KRV and other cISFs have evolved unique mechanisms to evade the mosquito's antiviral RNAi response, potentially using the highly structured 3' UTR as a decoy. This discovery provides new insights into how insect-specific flaviviruses interact with mosquito immune systems and could have implications for understanding the evolution of arboviruses and their transmission dynamics.

.. frame:: Abstract

  RNA interference (RNAi) plays an essential role in mosquito antiviral immunity, but it is not known whether viral small interfering RNA (siRNA) profiles differ between mosquito-borne and mosquito-specific viruses. A pan-Orthoflavivirus analysisin Aedes albopictus cells revealed that viral siRNAs were evenly distributed across the viral genome of most representatives of the Flavivirus genus. In contrast, siRNA production was biased toward the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the genomes of classical insect-specific flaviviruses (cISF), which was most pronounced for Kamiti River virus (KRV), a virus with a unique, 1.2 kb long 3' UTR. KRV-derived siRNAs were produced in high quantities and almost exclusively mapped to the 3' UTR. We mapped the 5' end of KRV subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs), products of the 5'−3' exoribonuclease XRN1/Pacman stalling on secondary RNA structures in the 3' UTR of the viral genome. We found that KRV produces high copy numbers of a long, 1,017 nt sfRNA1 and a short, 421 nt sfRNA2, corresponding to two predicted XRN1-resistant elements. Expression of both sfRNA1 and sfRNA2 was reduced in Pacman-deficient Aedes albopictus cells; however, this did not correlate with a shift in viral siRNA profiles. We suggest that cISFs, particularly KRV, developed a unique mechanism to produce high amounts of siRNAs as a decoy for the antiviral RNAi response in an sfRNA-independent manner.
