    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the advent of efficient strategies for experimental RNA structure
validation, especially combination of chemical probing with next-generation
sequencing technologies, came demand to couple experimental data,
e.g. SHAPE reactivities, with in silico RNA structure prediction tools. In
this line, the computational structure prediction is guided by in vitro or
even in vivo probing data.</p>

<p>We have recently implemented three previously published methods for
incorporation of SHAPE probing data into the <em>Vienna RNA Package</em> and
benchmarked prediction results with a set of RNAs with known reference
structures.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<blockquote><p>Summary: Chemical mapping experiments allow for nucleotide resolution
  assessment of RNA structure. We demonstrate that different strategies of
  integrating probing data with thermodynamics-based RNA secondary
  structure prediction algorithms can be implemented by means of soft
  constraints. This amounts to incorporating suitable pseudo-energies into
  the standard energy model for RNA secondary structures. As a showcase
  application for this new feature of the ViennaRNA Package we compare
  three distinct, previously published strategies to utilize SHAPE
  reactivities for structure prediction. The new tool is benchmarked on a
  set of RNAs with known reference structure.</p>

<p>Availability and implementation: The capability for SHAPE directed RNA
  folding is part of the upcoming release of the ViennaRNA Package 2.2, for
  which a preliminary release is already freely available at
  <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA">http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA</a>.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>mRNA degradation and translation are two processes crucial for
posttranscriptional gene regulation. While the strong interconnection of
mRNA degradation and translation has been noted for many years, it has led
to the hypothesis that mRNAs could be degraded on the ribosome.</p>

<p>We have recently published a study that strongly supports the hypothesis
that the ribosome is a very general site not only for general 5' to 3'
mRNA degradation in <em>Drosophila</em> but also for the miRNA-mediated mRNA

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<blockquote><p>The translation and degradation of mRNAs are two key steps in gene
expression that are highly regulated and targeted by many factors,
including microRNAs (miRNAs). While it is well established that translation
and mRNA degradation are tightly coupled, it is still not entirely clear
where in the cell mRNA degradation takes place. In this study, we
investigated the possibility of mRNA degradation on the ribosome in
Drosophila cells. Using polysome profiles and ribosome affinity
purification, we could demonstrate the copurification of various
deadenylation and decapping factors with ribosome complexes. Also, AGO1 and
GW182, two key factors in the miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation pathway, were
associated with ribosome complexes. Their copurification was dependent on
intact mRNAs, suggesting the association of these factors with the mRNA
rather than the ribosome itself. Furthermore, we isolated decapped mRNA
degradation intermediates from ribosome complexes and performed
high-throughput sequencing analysis. Interestingly, 93% of the decapped
mRNA fragments (approximately 12,000) could be detected at the same
relative abundance on ribosome complexes and in cell lysates. In summary,
our findings strongly indicate the association of the majority of bulk
mRNAs as well as mRNAs targeted by miRNAs with the ribosome during their
degradation.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Discrete energy landscapes provide a valuable means for analyzing
non-equilibrium properties of biopolymers. RNA folding dynamics, for
example, can be described by a continuous-time Markov process at the level
of local minima, their corresponding basins of attraction and saddle points
connecting them.</p>

<p>A connected set of structures, often denoted <em>state space</em> is required for
energy landscape construction. While complete suboptimal folding of RNA is
practically impossible for chain lengths above 100nt, alternative
strategies to enumerate the lower part of the energy landscape emerged over
the last years.</p>

<p>We have recently extended previous work on global flooding by a local
flooding approach that minimizes memory consumption and published the
method in <em>Bioinformatics</em>.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<blockquote><p>Motivation: Energy landscapes provide a valuable means for studying the
  folding dynamics of short RNA molecules in detail by modeling all
  possible structures and their transitions. Higher abstraction levels
  based on a macro-state decomposition of the landscape enable the study of
  larger systems; however, they are still restricted by huge memory
  requirements of exact approaches.</p>

<p>Results: We present a highly parallelizable local enumeration scheme that
  enables the computation of exact macro-state transition models with
  highly reduced memory requirements. The approach is evaluated on RNA
  secondary structure landscapes using a gradient basin definition for
  macro-states. Furthermore, we demonstrate the need for exact transition
  models by comparing two barrier-based approaches, and perform a detailed
  investigation of gradient basins in RNA energy landscapes.</p>

<p>Availability and implementation: Source code is part of the C++ Energy
  Landscape Library available at

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<blockquote><p>Background</p>

<p>Differential RNA sequencing dRNA-seq is a high-throughput screening
technique designed to examine the architecture of bacterial operons in
general and the precise position of transcription start sites (TSS) in
particular. Hitherto, dRNA-seq data were analyzed by visualizing the
sequencing reads mapped to the reference genome and manually annotating
reliable positions. This is very labor intensive and, due to the
subjectivity, biased.</p>

<p>Results</p>

<p>Here, we present <strong>TSSAR</strong>, a tool for automated <em>de-novo</em> TSS annotation
from dRNA-seq data that respects the statistics of dRNA-seq
libraries. <strong>TSSAR</strong> uses the premise that the number of sequencing reads
starting at a certain genomic position within a transcriptional active
region follows a Poisson distribution with a parameter that depends on the
local strength of expression. The differences of two dRNA-seq library
counts thus follow a Skellam distribution. This provides a statistical
basis to identify significantly enriched primary transcripts.</p>

<p>We assessed the performance by analyzing a publicly available dRNA-seq
  data set using <strong>TSSAR</strong> and two simple approaches that utilize
  user-defined score cutoffs. We evaluated the power of reproducing the
  manual TSS annotation. Furthermore, the same data set was used to
  reproduce 74 experimentally validated TSS in <em>H. pylori</em> from reliable
  techniques such as RACE or primer extension. Both analyses showed that
  <strong>TSSAR</strong> outperforms the static cutoff-dependent approaches.</p>

<p>Conclusions</p>

<p>Having an automated and efficient tool for analyzing dRNA-seq data
  facilitates the use of the dRNA-seq technique and promotes its
  application to more sophisticated analysis. For instance, monitoring the
  plasticity and dynamics of the transcriptomal architecture triggered by
  different stimuli and growth conditions becomes possible.</p>

<p>The main asset of a novel tool for dRNA-seq analysis that reaches out to
a broad user community is usability. As such, we provide <strong>TSSAR</strong> both as
intuitive RESTful Web service [<a href="http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/TSSAR">http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/TSSAR</a>] together
with a set of post-processing and analysis tools, as well as a
stand-alone version for use in high-throughput dRNA-seq data analysis
pipelines.</p>
