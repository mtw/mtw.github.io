    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>mRNA degradation and translation are two processes crucial for
posttranscriptional gene regulation. While the strong interconnection of
mRNA degradation and translation has been noted for many years, it has led
to the hypothesis that mRNAs could be degraded on the ribosome.</p>

<p>We have recently published a study that strongly supports the hypothesis
that the ribosome is a very general site not only for general 5' to 3'
mRNA degradation in <em>Drosophila</em> but also for the miRNA-mediated mRNA
degradation pathway:</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<blockquote><p>The translation and degradation of mRNAs are two key steps in gene
expression that are highly regulated and targeted by many factors,
including microRNAs (miRNAs). While it is well established that translation
and mRNA degradation are tightly coupled, it is still not entirely clear
where in the cell mRNA degradation takes place. In this study, we
investigated the possibility of mRNA degradation on the ribosome in
Drosophila cells. Using polysome profiles and ribosome affinity
purification, we could demonstrate the copurification of various
deadenylation and decapping factors with ribosome complexes. Also, AGO1 and
GW182, two key factors in the miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation pathway, were
associated with ribosome complexes. Their copurification was dependent on
intact mRNAs, suggesting the association of these factors with the mRNA
rather than the ribosome itself. Furthermore, we isolated decapped mRNA
degradation intermediates from ribosome complexes and performed
high-throughput sequencing analysis. Interestingly, 93% of the decapped
mRNA fragments (approximately 12,000) could be detected at the same
relative abundance on ribosome complexes and in cell lysates. In summary,
our findings strongly indicate the association of the majority of bulk
mRNAs as well as mRNAs targeted by miRNAs with the ribosome during their
degradation.</p></blockquote>

been a major challenge for the last years. To address this issue, we have
developped <a href="http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/TSSAR">TSSAR</a>, a statistical method

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<blockquote><p>Background</p>

<p>Differential RNA sequencing dRNA-seq is a high-throughput screening
technique designed to examine the architecture of bacterial operons in
general and the precise position of transcription start sites (TSS) in
particular. Hitherto, dRNA-seq data were analyzed by visualizing the
sequencing reads mapped to the reference genome and manually annotating
reliable positions. This is very labor intensive and, due to the
subjectivity, biased.</p>

<p>Results</p>

<p>Here, we present <strong>TSSAR</strong>, a tool for automated <em>de-novo</em> TSS annotation
from dRNA-seq data that respects the statistics of dRNA-seq
libraries. <strong>TSSAR</strong> uses the premise that the number of sequencing reads
starting at a certain genomic position within a transcriptional active
region follows a Poisson distribution with a parameter that depends on the
local strength of expression. The differences of two dRNA-seq library
counts thus follow a Skellam distribution. This provides a statistical
basis to identify significantly enriched primary transcripts.</p>

<p>We assessed the performance by analyzing a publicly available dRNA-seq
  data set using <strong>TSSAR</strong> and two simple approaches that utilize
  user-defined score cutoffs. We evaluated the power of reproducing the
  manual TSS annotation. Furthermore, the same data set was used to
  reproduce 74 experimentally validated TSS in <em>H. pylori</em> from reliable
  techniques such as RACE or primer extension. Both analyses showed that
  <strong>TSSAR</strong> outperforms the static cutoff-dependent approaches.</p>

<p>Conclusions</p>

<p>Having an automated and efficient tool for analyzing dRNA-seq data
  facilitates the use of the dRNA-seq technique and promotes its
  application to more sophisticated analysis. For instance, monitoring the
  plasticity and dynamics of the transcriptomal architecture triggered by
  different stimuli and growth conditions becomes possible.</p>

<p>The main asset of a novel tool for dRNA-seq analysis that reaches out to
a broad user community is usability. As such, we provide <strong>TSSAR</strong> both as
intuitive RESTful Web service [<a href="http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/TSSAR">http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/TSSAR</a>] together
with a set of post-processing and analysis tools, as well as a
stand-alone version for use in high-throughput dRNA-seq data analysis
pipelines.</p>
