<h2>Abstract</h2>

<blockquote><p>Background</p>

<p>Differential RNA sequencing dRNA-seq is a high-throughput screening
technique designed to examine the architecture of bacterial operons in
general and the precise position of transcription start sites (TSS) in
particular. Hitherto, dRNA-seq data were analyzed by visualizing the
sequencing reads mapped to the reference genome and manually annotating
reliable positions. This is very labor intensive and, due to the
subjectivity, biased.</p>

<p>Results</p>

<p>Here, we present <strong>TSSAR</strong>, a tool for automated <em>de-novo</em> TSS annotation
from dRNA-seq data that respects the statistics of dRNA-seq
libraries. <strong>TSSAR</strong> uses the premise that the number of sequencing reads
starting at a certain genomic position within a transcriptional active
region follows a Poisson distribution with a parameter that depends on the
local strength of expression. The differences of two dRNA-seq library
counts thus follow a Skellam distribution. This provides a statistical
basis to identify significantly enriched primary transcripts.</p>

<p>We assessed the performance by analyzing a publicly available dRNA-seq
  data set using <strong>TSSAR</strong> and two simple approaches that utilize
  user-defined score cutoffs. We evaluated the power of reproducing the
  manual TSS annotation. Furthermore, the same data set was used to
  reproduce 74 experimentally validated TSS in <em>H. pylori</em> from reliable
  techniques such as RACE or primer extension. Both analyses showed that
  <strong>TSSAR</strong> outperforms the static cutoff-dependent approaches.</p>

<p>Conclusions</p>

<p>Having an automated and efficient tool for analyzing dRNA-seq data
  facilitates the use of the dRNA-seq technique and promotes its
  application to more sophisticated analysis. For instance, monitoring the
  plasticity and dynamics of the transcriptomal architecture triggered by
  different stimuli and growth conditions becomes possible.</p>

<p>The main asset of a novel tool for dRNA-seq analysis that reaches out to
a broad user community is usability. As such, we provide <strong>TSSAR</strong> both as
intuitive RESTful Web service [<a href="http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/TSSAR">http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/TSSAR</a>] together
with a set of post-processing and analysis tools, as well as a
stand-alone version for use in high-throughput dRNA-seq data analysis
pipelines.</p>
