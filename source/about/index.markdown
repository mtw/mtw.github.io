[rna-seq.at](http://rna-seq.at) serves mainly as a collection of thoughts, code and snippets in the context of **open source RNA bioinformatics** and **computational biology**. The focus is _not_ restricted to **RNA-seq** related bioinf issues but covers a wide spectrum of topics in theoretical RNA chemistry and biology, ranging from RNA folding and RNA design over statistical physics and energy landscape theory to synthetic biology.

## About the author
My name is Michael Thomas Wolfinger, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max F. Perutz Laboratories](http://www.mfpl.ac.at), University of Vienna, Austria. You can find me at the Institute for Theoretical Chemistry's [Theoretical Biochemistry Group (TBI)](http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at) (home of the [Vienna RNA package](http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ronny/RNA/index.html)).

I'm involved in the special research program [RNA regulation of the transcriptome (RNA-REG)](http://www.mfpl.ac.at/rna-biology/focus-regulatory-rna/program/), funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF. While I'm mainly doing *RNA-seq* related bioinformatics these days, I have extensively touched the above topics during my academic career and I'm planning to write on these subjects in the near future.
